# Cyclistic Bike Share
## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering company in chicago. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## Questions for the analysis
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become    members?

## In order to answer the key business questions, we will follow:
Data analysis phases: Prepare, Process, Analyze

## Business task
To analyze and identify trends in Cyclistic's historical trip data to help Design marketing strategies build effective campaigns.

# Joining Data
```{r}
bike_rides <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7,df8,df9,df10,df11,df12)
bike_rides <- remove_empty(bike_rides,which= c("cols"))
bike_rides <- remove_empty(bike_rides,which= c("rows"))

head(bike_rides)
```


# Cleaning and Processing Data

#### Changing the date formats
```{r}
bike_rides$started_at <- ymd_hms(bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$ended_at <- ymd_hms(bike_rides$ended_at)

head(bike_rides)
```

#### Adding more columns Ride length, Day of week, Year, month and Ride duration
```{r}
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>% mutate(Ride_length = seconds_to_period(ended_at-started_at))
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>% mutate(Day_of_week = wday(started_at))
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>% mutate(Year = year(started_at))
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>% mutate(Month = month.abb[month(started_at)])
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>% mutate(Ride_duration = (ended_at-started_at))

head(bike_rides)
```

#### Finding min, max and mean
```{r}
Min_Bike_Rides <- min(bike_rides$Ride_length)
Mean_Bike_Rides <- mean(bike_rides$Ride_length)
Max_Bike_Rides <- max(bike_rides$Ride_length)

Min_Bike_Rides
Mean_Bike_Rides
Max_Bike_Rides
```

## Analysing Data

#### Mean ride length on membership and yearly basis
```{r echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
bike_rides_result <- bike_rides %>% select(member_casual,Ride_length,Year) %>%
group_by(member_casual,Year) %>% summarise(Avg_ride_length = mean(Ride_length))

bike_rides_result
```

#### Number of rides on membership and weekly basis
```{r echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
bike_rides_result1 <- bike_rides %>% select(member_casual,Ride_length,Day_of_week) %>%
group_by(member_casual,Day_of_week) %>% summarise(Number_of_rides = n())

bike_rides_result1
```

#### Number of rides on weekly basis
```{r}
bike_rides_result2 <- bike_rides %>% select(member_casual,Ride_length,Day_of_week) %>%
group_by(Day_of_week) %>% summarise(Number_of_rides = n())

bike_rides_result2
```

#### Summarizing the trip duration
```{r echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
bike_rides_result4 <- bike_rides %>% select(Day_of_week,Ride_duration,member_casual) %>% 
group_by(Day_of_week,member_casual) %>% summarise(Trip_Duration = quantile(minute(seconds_to_period(Ride_duration)),
prob = c(0.15,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.85))) 
```


## Converting Data from Longer to wider format
```{r}
bike_rides_result <- bike_rides_result %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from  = Year, values_from = Avg_ride_length)

bike_rides_result

bike_rides_result1 <- bike_rides_result1 %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from  = Day_of_week, values_from = Number_of_rides)

bike_rides_result1

bike_rides_result2 <- bike_rides_result2 %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from  = Day_of_week, values_from = Number_of_rides)

bike_rides_result2
```

# Visualization

#### Yearly Analysis for Casual vs Annual membership
```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_rides)+ 
geom_bar(mapping= aes(x= Year,fill=member_casual),position="dodge") +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2020,2021))+
facet_wrap(~rideable_type)+
labs(title="Cyclistic Bike Share" , subtitle= "Comparison between Casual and Member Riders Year-On-Year with different Rides", y = "Count of Rides")
```

##### The above analysis might not be appropriate since we have considered last 6 month data out of which we have only 2 months data of year 2022.

#### Monthly Analysis for Casual vs Annual membership
```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_rides)+ 
geom_bar(mapping= aes(x= Month,fill=member_casual)) +
theme(legend.position = "top",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))+ 
labs(title="Cyclistic Bike Share" , subtitle= "Comparison between Casual and Member Riders Month-on-Month basis with different Rides type", y = "Count of Rides")+
facet_wrap(~Year) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_rides)+ 
geom_bar(mapping= aes(x= Month,fill=member_casual)) +
theme(legend.position = "top",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))+ 
labs(title="Cyclistic Bike Share" , subtitle= "Comparison between Casual and Member Riders Month-on-Month basis with different Rides type", y = "Count of Rides")+
facet_wrap(~rideable_type)
```


#### Weekly analysis for Casual vs Annual membership
```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_rides)+ 
geom_bar(mapping= aes(x= Day_of_week,fill = factor(Day_of_week))) + theme(legend.position="none")+
facet_wrap(~member_casual) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1:7),
labels = c("Sun","Mon","Tues","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat"))+
labs(title="Cyclistic Bike Share" , subtitle= "Analyzing which Week-Day has maximum Rides", y = "Count of Rides")
```

#### Trip duration weekly analysis
```{r}
ggplot(data = bike_rides_result4)+ 
geom_boxplot(mapping= aes(x= factor(Day_of_week), y=Trip_Duration, fill=member_casual),position="dodge") +
theme(legend.position="bottom")+
scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1:7),labels = c("Sun","Mon","Tues","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat")) +
labs(title="Cyclistic Bike Share" , subtitle= "Trip Duration for each Ride on Week-Day basis comparing Casual Vs Annual members", x="Day_of_week" ,y = "Duration (mins)")
